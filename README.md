# Assignment-3-Linked-lists-and-recursion
Assignment-3 is a individual assignment. And you need to submit 4 separate links to your PRs. However you can take help from team members and communicate in slack about the obstacles you face during solving the problem.
## Instructions 
1. Please find the challenges below.
2. Write the program to solve following challenges implementing Linked Lists and recursion that we have studied recently. 
3. Please also prepare a brief report in a markdown file. 
4. Please use the branch name and filename for each report specified in each challenge, and write your code and report in the respective branch. 
5. Please send 4 different PRs for the 4 branches of 4 different problems mentioned below. 


**Note:** Your PR should contain following content
1. Name solution file itself. For example: swap-nodes.cpp, summation.cpp
2. A short report written in markdown. For example: swap-nodes.md, summation.dm
